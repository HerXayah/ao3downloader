# AO3 Downloader

This program allows you, to download Fanfics from AO3 in the EPUB format only. I'm lazy and only use EPUB so lol.
This is made to be run on a server where you can just attach yourself into all the time (Like Unraid)

This does not have any way to login or something, so you might wanna use [this AO3 Downloader](https://github.com/nianeyna/ao3downloader) instead for these.

_Also got no clue what bomb will go off when you try to download a Fanfic that requires a login or what happens when you input a wrong fic as it's just for my own use case not gonna lie_

### WARNING!!!

This does not rate limit at all lol.
